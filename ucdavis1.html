            <div class="salutation">Dear Hiring Manager,</div>

            <div class="letter-body">
                <p>I am excited to apply for the Data Coordinator position at Boromir Ventures which I found on a Handshake posting shared with me by a career advisor. I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UC Davis and have been on the search for a full time position which combines my passion for social equity and rigorous data analysis. I am confident that my statistical and programming skills gained through coursework and a previous student job, combined with my alignment with your organizational mission, make me an ideal candidate for the position.</p>

                <p>During my academic career, I honed my skills in database administration and quantitative analysis. My coursework used R for data manipulation and analysis, and I have a lot of experience with Microsoft Excel, including advanced formulas. I also completed a capstone project where I developed a database for a fictional international aid organization. In this project I also created a roadmap to analyzing project outcomes, similar to the responsibilities outlined for this role.</p>

                <p>In my internship as an office assistant at the Aerospace Engineering department, I was responsible for managing alumni data and outreach. While it wasn't strictly a requirement, I took initiative to create several automated reports, which helped me to save time and to improve data accuracy. While this part-time job didn't give me enough time to finish the project, I have experimented with using Python to automate data importing and cleaning steps. My role also required attention to detail and the ability to handle concurrent tasks and deadlines effectively, all while working in a noisy environment with frequent interruption.</p>

                <p>I am particularly drawn to this position because of Boromir Ventures' commitment to creating meaningful impacts in the lives of children. I had often considered minoring in human development, and nearly took enough classes to do so. I am very interested in making a difference for marginalized populations, and have contributed in various ways such as club membership, and organizing petitions to change university policies.</p>

                <p>Thank you for considering my application! I am confident that my technical skills, experience with programming and data analysis, and drive to improve society all make me a great fit!</p>
