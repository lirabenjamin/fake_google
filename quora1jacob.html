                <p>I was A2A, so I'll give it a shot. I have 2 examples to share. One is amusing. One is actually good. Both read like they were written by smart, functional, thinking human beings. Sadly, this is rarer than you might think.</p>
                
                <div class="section-header">Amusing</div>
                
                <p>Heh, so, I wouldn't say that this is strictly the best cover letter I've seen across all dimensions, but it's certainly one of the most memorable. Though we initially reached out of a morbid fascination (coupled with a strong resume), it did get our attention enough to bring on someone that ended up staying with the company in question for 6 years, evangelizing UX like crazy, slaying cruft and bullshit at every turn, and all in all, being one of the best PMs I've ever had the pleasure of working with. For context, the gentleman in question wrote this gem when he was a new grad.</p>
                
                <div class="cover-letter-example">
                    <p><strong>Dear Recruitment Officer:</strong></p>
                    <p>The fact that you are reading this means that I am already dead. Had I still been amongst the living, I could have brought my passion for improving user experiences and innovative software to your company. I would have used my excellent analytical skills to help improve current projects and envision new ones. My communications and interpersonal skills would have been utilized to maintain an efficient and pleasant office environment. My ability to quickly learn and apply new skills would have allowed me to contribute positively to a wide range of projects. All in all, I would have become an integral part of my team. Unfortunately, I am dead. Fortunately, Dr. Frank N. Stein assures me that my current state can be worked around, and aside from occasionally being chased by pitchfork-wielding villagers, I would remain an exceptional employee. I hope to hear from you in the future.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>

                </div>
                
                <p>I want to emphasize that cutesy things like this are not a substitute for being good at stuff. If this candidate's resume hadn't been strong of its own accord, this letter would have been less charming and more... pathetic. One thing to note is that this letter is well-written, and that's actually huge (most cover letters are rife with typos, grammatical errors, and confusing, unclear writing).</p>
                
                <div class="section-header">Actually Good</div>
                
                <div class="cover-letter-example">
                    <p><strong>Greetings!</strong></p>
                    <p>I was browsing through CrunchBoard where I saw that you're hiring. I'm a smart and hardworking guy who's just starting his programming career, and I'm looking to do some great work. [snip] sounds like a really cool place to do said work, and I very much hope I can be a useful addition to the team.</p>
                    <p>I've put together a practice and demonstration project that you can check out, built using Python and Django. It's a simple, moderately-customizable to-do list that allows the user to estimate how long tasks take, and then compare their estimates with how long they actually took. The source is available on github here. I've also attached my resume, and my LinkedIn profile has some additional background.</p>
                    <p><strong>All the very best,</strong><br>[snip]</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>This doesn't look like much, but from reading it, it's clear that a smart, thinking person who is at least a little bit passionate about coding wrote it. You'd think that letters like this would be common, but believe me, they're not. When you see something so simple, well-written, and earnest in a sea of platitudes, cliches, and rampant grammatical errors, you sit up and take notice.</p>

                <p>Your cover letter is like the first stage of a rocket ship. It's purpose is to boost your resume past the gatekeepers at HR, so that it gets into the pile forwarded to the hiring manager.</p>
                
                <p>HR isn't technical enough to see how your technical qualifications match their needs. So your cover letter tells them. The <span class="highlight">'best' cover letter</span>, the one that really improved my rate of callbacks, has three sections.</p>
                
                <p>The first section is a couple of sentences saying, "This is in response to your ad for a &lt;job&gt; I saw in &lt;source&gt;. My qualifications are a good match to your requirements, as detailed below."</p>
                
                <p>The second, and most important part is a bullet list of their requirements, in the same order as they appear in the ad, except with your qualification substituted. So, if their ad says "3 to 10 years C++ development experience", the corresponding bullet in my cover letter says "20+ years full time C++ development experience".</p>
                
                <p>The third part is built around "You can contact me at (xxx) xxx-xxxx".</p>
                
                <p>I write each cover letter specifically for the job, whereas my resume is the same for every application. I've done this so many times that the writing goes very quickly.</p>

                <p>The best cover letter that I ever read almost got the individual the job. It was approximately one page long. Just long enough that I was willing to start reading it although I was skeptical about the length.</p>
                
                <p>The position was for a Montessori teacher. She started by telling me how much Montessori education meant to her, covered her educational background and work experience. She actually touched on some other educational theories that showed her wide range of knowledge and experience and connected with me personally by doing so. In essence, she summarized her resume with a beautiful letter. Then she finished with why she was interested in the specific job.</p>
                
                <p>This is in contrast to a cover letter that came within the same week for the same position that said, "I'm interested in the job you posted at URL. See attached resume."</p>
                
                <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> That same individual had an interview with me. I felt like she was on, or had recently been on drugs and was a danger to children. I was not ever going to let her in the building again. But, it was the best cover letter that I've ever seen.</p>
