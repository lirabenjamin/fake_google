        <p>Dear Alex Yu,</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>I am writing to express my great interest in the Global Study Program Student Assistant. I am a 2nd year History major with an intended minor in Chicanx Studies. It has always been a dream of mine to work in international relations, and this position drew my interest because I think that it will be an excellent next step on my path. I like to think of myself as very involved on-campus, and I have various experiences engaging with different social and cultural organizations. My passion for helping people from other cultures, club leadership experience, and office-work skills all serve to make me an excellent candidate for this position.</p>
    
    <p>What excites me most about this position is the chance to further develop my ability to engage in inter-cultural dialogue. My life experience has helped me to feel in my gut that people are people, no matter what. My family moved to the United States when I was fairly young and it wasn't always easy understanding the language, cultural differences, etc. I am lucky to have had many "helpers" in my life and I think that I could be a great "helper" in this position. I also happen to be trilingual which could help me communicate with many students.</p>
    
    <p>My student organization leadership experience helped me to gain many of the necessary skills. I developed valuable skills in event planning, mentorship, and administrative support for the club â€”skills that align perfectly with the responsibilities outlined for the Student Assistant position. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to assist with the coordination of cultural activities and social events. As the club secretary I kept track of financial information using Microsoft Excel, and helped to organize event structure using PowerPoint presentations. I am also adept at using social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, which I can leverage to effectively market events and engage with students.</p>
    
    <p>I am very excited to talk more about how my personal mission, and club/organization experience set me up for success in this position. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and growing alongside it!</p>
    
    <p>Sincerely,<br>
    Jorda Marque<br>
