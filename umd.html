                <h3>Introductory Paragraph:</h3>
                <p>This paragraph is all about catching the reader's attention and getting them excited to read the rest of your cover letter. Start simply by stating what position you're applying for and convey your excitement and interest in the role. Tell how you learned of the opening (if referred by someone - professor, relative, former employer/employee, etc. - it is a good idea to mention that person's name and that they suggested you apply). After that, you'll close this paragraph by stating specific reason(s) for your interest in the position and/or the organization. There are multiple ways you can do this, but think about how you can simply state why this position is a good fit for you and why you're a good fit for the organization you're applying to (in 1-3 sentences). Think about doing something like researching their mission/vision/values online and commenting on the alignment between your experience/interests/skills/knowledge/values and who they are. Essentially, you want to show the employer that you're being thoughtful and intentional about your application. You're providing them with a reason to read on.</p>
                
                <h3>Body Paragraphs:</h3>
                <p>There isn't a perfect amount of body paragraphs to have, but you'll typically only have space for a couple of body paragraphs while keeping your letter to a page in length. In essence, your body paragraphs are conveying information about your past experiences, the skills/knowledge/abilities you developed in those experiences, and how they apply directly to the role you're applying for. Start by highlighting your single most relevant past experience, explain what skills/knowledge/abilities you developed, and then tell the organization why it matters to them. The employer wants to know why you're a good fit for this position, but they want to know that you're thinking about your fit in relation to who they are, what they do, etc. This can be as simple as saying something to the tune of: "my strong base of skills in 'x' area will serve me effectively in this role for 'y' reason". Make sure to be specific and concise here. Tip: Focus more in-depth on a couple of experiences rather than listing all of your past experiences. Remember, they also have your resume! Give them your why here.</p>
                
                <h3>Closing Paragraph:</h3>
                <p>Briefly reiterate your interest in the position and consider providing a concise statement about your fit with the organization/position. Indicate your desire to speak with them further and be polite and gracious). Remind them of the best way to get in touch and that you're looking forward to hearing from them. Thank the reader for their time and consideration.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Juan Sebastian Roa:</p>
                    
                    <p>I recently located the Communications Intern position with the Spanish Education Development (SED) Center through the University of Maryland's job and internship database, Handshake. I am a second-year student majoring in communication and intend to minor in Spanish Language and Cultures, which is my native language. I am interested in this position because it represents a convergence of both of my interests - education through media, particularly social media, and the Spanish language and culture. I have strong written and verbal communication skills and extensive experience using social media platforms to boost the engagement of campus-wide student organizations.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am excited for the opportunity to apply these skills to further the mission of SED in the role of Communications Intern. I have had several opportunities to refine and strengthen my written and verbal communication skills. For example, as a Teaching Assistant for an Introduction to Communication course at the University of Maryland, I had the opportunity to collaborate with an instructor professor to tailor the curriculum to meet student's needs, as well as liaise between the professor and a class of 30 students.</p>
                    
                    <p>Furthermore, I graded papers and helped students identify areas of improvement in their writing, led group discussions, and took advantage of the opportunity to present to the class the role of language and communication in today's global society. Similarly, I have also developed competency with using several social media outlets. This past year, I was the public relations and social media chair for a student organization - the Undergraduate Communication Association (UCA). Independently, I developed a strategic 1-year plan that detailed how TikTok and Instagram could be utilized to engage more people on campus. Our end-of-year report showed that this plan resulted in a 70% increase in event attendance and a 25% increase in club membership.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am very excited to bring these communication and social media strategizing skills to the Spanish Education Development Center, whose mission truly represents the kind of work I hope to contribute to in my career. I look forward to hearing from you regarding the next steps in the application process.</p>

<div class="sample-letter">
    <p>123 Elm Street<br>
    College Park, MD 20740</p>

    <p>April 1, 20XX</p>

    <p>Nicole Thomas<br>
    Director, Quality Control<br>
    Merck & Company, Inc.<br>
    410 Georgia Avenue, NW<br>
    Washington, DC 20001</p>

    <p>Dear Ms. Thomas:</p>

    <p>At the University of Maryland Fall Career & Internship Fair, I had the opportunity to speak with a recruiter and learn about the entry-level Quality Control position available with Merck & Company, Inc. I will graduate in May with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, specializing in statistics. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to cultivate my interest in corporate production and plant management through rigorous coursework, insightful internships, and involvement in business-related student organizations with peers who shared my curiosities.</p>

    <p>I am excited to apply the skills I have gained at Merck & Company, Inc. My interest in operational excellence is grounded in a strong theoretical foundation. At UMD, I had the chance to gain field-relevant critical thinking skills through courses such as Applied Research Methods, Business Statistics, Collective Bargaining, and Operations Management. Then, I had the opportunity to apply my academic learning through various internships. For example, last summer, I worked at Kraft Foods as a production intern. In that role, I gained valuable experience in both quality control and operations management.</p>

    <p>As I learned about the importance of delivering safe food products customers can trust, I became interested in applying my skills in the broader healthcare industry, which led me to research the work of Merck & Company, Inc. In addition to internships, I have also been active in many business-related campus clubs and organizations, which have continued to foster my interest in the successful functioning of large-scale businesses and companies.</p>

    <p>To conclude, I believe my motivation, independent work ethic, and aptitude for statistics make me a strong candidate for this position.</p>
