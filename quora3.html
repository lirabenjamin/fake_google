                <p><strong>Related:</strong> What is the best cover letter you have ever read or written?</p>
                
                <p>I was A2A, so I'll give it a shot. I have 2 examples to share. One is amusing. One is actually good. Both read like they were written by smart, functional, thinking human beings. Sadly, this is rarer than you might think.</p>

                <h3>Amusing</h3>
                
                <p>Heh, so, I wouldn't say that this is strictly the best cover letter I've seen across all dimensions, but it's certainly one of the most memorable. Though we initially reached out of a morbid fascination (coupled with a strong resume), it did get our attention enough to bring on someone that ended up staying with the company in question for 6 years, evangelizing UX like crazy, slaying cruft and bullshit at every turn, and all in all, being one of the best PMs I've ever had the pleasure of working with. For context, the gentleman in question wrote this gem when he was a new grad.</p>

                    Dear Recruitment Officer:<br><br>

                    The fact that you are reading this means that I am already dead. Had I still been amongst the living, I could have brought my passion for improving user experiences and innovative software to your company. I would have used my excellent analytical skills to help improve current projects and envision new ones. My communications and interpersonal skills would have been utilized to maintain an efficient and pleasant office environment. My ability to quickly learn and apply new skills would have allowed me to contribute positively to a wide range of projects. All in all, I would have become an integral part of my team. Unfortunately, I am dead. Fortunately, Dr. Frank N. Stein assures me that my current state can be worked around, and aside from occasionally being chased by pitchfork-wielding villagers, I would remain an exceptional employee. I hope to hear from you in the future.<br><br>

                    Sincerely,<br><br>

                    [snip] "It's Alive" [snip]
                </div>

                <p>I want to emphasize that cutesy things like this are not a substitute for being good at stuff. If this candidate's resume hadn't been strong of its own accord, this letter would have been less charming and more... pathetic. One thing to note is that this letter is well-written, and that's actually huge (most cover letters are rife with typos, grammatical errors, and confusing, unclear writing).</p>

                <h3>Actually Good</h3>

                <div class="letter-content">
                    Greetings!<br><br>

                    I was browsing through CrunchBoard where I saw that you're hiring. I'm a smart and hardworking guy who's just starting his programming career, and I'm looking to do some great work. [snip] sounds like a really cool place to do said work, and I very much hope I can be a useful addition to the team.<br><br>

                    I've put together a practice and demonstration project that you can check out, built using Python and Django. It's a simple, moderately-customizable to-do list that allows the user to estimate how long tasks take, and then compare their estimates with how long they actually took. The source is available on github here. I've also attached my resume, and my LinkedIn profile has some additional background.<br><br>

                    All the very best,<br>
                    [snip]
                </div>

                <p>This doesn't look like much, but from reading it, it's clear that a smart, thinking person who is at least a little bit passionate about coding wrote it. You'd think that letters like this would be common, but believe me, they're not. When you see something so simple, well-written, and earnest in a sea of platitudes, cliches, and rampant grammatical errors, you sit up and take notice.</p>

                <h3>What are the dumbest financial mistakes most Americans make?</h3>
                <p>Where do I start?</p>
                <p>I'm a huge financial nerd, and have spent an embarrassing amount of time talking to people about their money habits.</p>
                <p>Here are the biggest mistakes people are making and how to fix them:</p>
                
                <p><strong>1. Not having a separate high interest savings account:</strong> Having a separate account allows you to see the results of all your hard work and keep your money separate so you're less tempted to spend it. Plus with rates above 5.00%, the interest you can earn compared to most banks really adds up.</p>
                
                <p>Here is a list of the top savings accounts available today. Deposit $5 before moving on because this is one of the biggest mistakes and easiest ones to fix.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Overpaying on car insurance:</strong> You've heard it a million times before, but the average American family still overspends by $417/year on car insurance. If you've been with the same insurer for years, chances are you are one of them.</p>
                
                <p>Pull up Coverage.com, a free site that will compare prices for you, answer the questions on the page, and it will show you how much you could be saving.</p>
                
                <p>That's it. You'll likely be saving a bunch of money.</p>
                
                <p><strong>3. Not using a debt relief program:</strong> People with $10K in credit card debt can get significant reductions by using a debt relief program. Don't suffer alone, here's a quick 2 minute quiz that will tell you if you qualify.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4. Not earning free money while investing:</strong> Most people think investing is complicated or for the rich. Not anymore. There are platforms that literally give you free money just to get started. Deposit as little as $25, and you could get up to $1000 in bonus funds. This is the site I recommend to my friends.</p>
                
                <h3>How to get started</h3>
                <p>Hope this helps! Here are the links to get started:</p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Have a separate savings account</li>
                    <li>Stop overpaying for car insurance</li>
                    <li>Finally get out of debt</li>
                    <li>Start investing with a free bonus</li>

                <p>Realistically, No. If you are going to go to the trouble to craft a cover letter, then you need to write that letter specifically for that job. Take the time and effort to write a great cover letter or do not waste your time.</p>
                <p>An application is a little different. You need to fill out the information that the application asks for and do not give extraneous data.</p>

                <p><strong>Related:</strong> Why are cover letters important for a job application?</p>
                
                <p>Unless you are applying for a grunt job at a meat market, the cover letter is where you demonstrate your communications skills and market yourself. The only employers who don't care about your communications skills are those who don't care if you ever advance your career.</p>

                <h3>RESUME</h3>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Keep it factual and easy to read, with the common format: Name and Contact information, Education and skills, Experience in reverse chronological order, Awards/Publications if you got them. No bullshit. No "hobbies and interests". No "references on request". No "career objectives".</li>
                    <li>Describe what you did, not what you were supposed to do. Accomplishments, not responsibilities. "Responsible for managing the company before it went bankrupt" will not get you a new job.</li>
                    <li>Remove all adjectives and adverbs. Describe FACTS, not opinions. And put things in numerical dollar terms if at all possible. "Responsible for designing a better widget" is bullshit. "Designed a widget that generated $10 million in revenue" is impressive.</li>
                    <li>Your resume is an important indicator of how well you communicate. Use sentences. Avoid bullet lists, but if you must, make sure they are done correctly. Spell out acronyms. Make certain the English is perfect. Write it in the third person, and refer to yourself by name.</li>
                    <li>Keep it positive. Describe the things you did that can contribute to the new job. Do so in a positive way. "Found a way to evade liability for malfunctioning widgets" is only good if you're a lawyer. "Increased widget reliability by 140%" is much better.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>COVER LETTER</h3>
                <p>Your RESUME is for FACTS. Market yourself in your cover letter and show them your ability to develop a good essay. Most professional occupations require good writing and presentation skills to succeed, and this is your chance to show them you can contribute on that level.</p>
                
                <p>In the cover letter, tell them why you are their best candidate for the job. Explain how your experience at the widget company demonstrates how well you can contribute to their production of thingamabobs. Point out especially impressive bits and relate them to what the company does and the job you are applying for. Tell them why they need you, NOT why you need them.</p>
                
                <p>Adjectives ARE allowed. You're the most versatile, educated, skilled, productive employee on the planet … as long as you can back it up with facts in your resume.</p>
                
                <p>Remember: They are not a charity. They are not hiring you so you can buy a new car or pay your mortgage. They don't give a damn if you were captain of the squammish team or collected more 3 cent stamps than anyone else. They will hire you if they think that you can make the company more money.</p>
                
                <p>End with the presumption that you meet in person, and tell them how to contact you to set a date and time. Make the HR person who gets your letter worry that if they don't give the manager a chance to hire you, they might be held at fault.</p>
                
                <p>Your goal should be one resume = one job interview. In the interview, you can be more casual, discuss your leadership skills on the squammish team, etc. etc. Show your interest, offer ideas, tell them how anxious you are to show what you can do for them. The interview is your chance to make them feel like you are already a part of their thingamabob team.</p>
