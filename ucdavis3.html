        <p>Dear Ms. Black,</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>I am applying for the Environmental Scientist position at ETI Professionals listed in Handshake (5710801). I was drawn to ETI's commitment to strategic and innovative solutions to the world's environmental challenges. I believe I am a strong candidate for this position due to my knowledge of state and national regulations, my strong communication skills, and my hands-on field research experience.</p>
    
    <p>I will graduate from the University of California, Davis with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Policy Analysis and Planning and a Bachelor of Arts in Communication in June 2026. These degrees have prepared me well by developing my working knowledge of environmental impact assessments, CEQA, NEPA and other environmental regulations as well as honed my report writing and verbal communication skills. In addition to my coursework, I have experience in the field. As a fellow with the US EPA in Philadelphia, I reviewed and provided comments on Environmental Impact statements, used GIS to update publication quality maps, and interfaced with numerous federal and private agencies. As a planning intern with Sacramento County, I conducted a jobs/housing balance study where I incorporated input from the public with County needs. At the Student and Landowner Education and Watershed Stewardship program (SLEWS), I honed my communication and organizational skills through weekly presentations about native species, ecosystems and soil characterization.</p>
    
    <p>I feel I would make an excellent Environmental Scientist with ETI Professionals. I have a strong work ethic, I work well with teams, and I want to be part of a company that develops strategic solutions to make the world a better place. I look forward to an interview with you to further discuss my qualifications.</p>
    
    <p>Sincerely,<br>
    Eun Dae "Audrey" Kim</p>
