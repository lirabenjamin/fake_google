        <p>Dr. Louise Evans, PhD<br>
        The Culture Collaborative<br>
        867 Front Street<br>
        Sacramento, CA 95814</p>
        
        <p>Dear Dr. Evans:</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>I am writing to express my interest in the Research and Educational Writing Intern position at The Culture Collaborative. I discovered this opportunity through Handshake. As I read more about the position and your organization, I believe that I am a strong candidate for this internship given my strong written communication skills, leadership experience, and commitment to diversity.</p>
    
    <p>As a student in my final year at the University of California, Davis, I have honed strong writing skills and the ability to effectively find, analyze and synthesize research. In addition to my coursework, I have experience conducting research and writing engaging, informative content for my university's official website. Through my past experiences, I have demonstrated my ability to be a valuable team member, as well as my leadership potential. For example, in my past internship, I rose to the challenge of developing and maintaining a weekly blog for a new startup company. I was given a lot of independence in my role as an intern and as a result, exercised diligence in initiating projects, setting deadlines, and delegating tasks when necessary to ensure follow-through. Lastly, in my current role at the Student Recruitment and Retention Center at UC Davis, I demonstrate my experience and passion for helping foster appreciation for culturally diverse communities.</p>
    
    <p>I am confident that my academic background, professional experiences, skills, and strong interest in the mission of The Culture Collaborative make me a strong fit for the Research and Educational Writing internship. I have attached my resume for your consideration. Please feel free to contact me at mmabara@ucdavis.edu or (530) 752-1234 at your convenience to discuss my qualifications for the role. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
    
    <p>Best Regards,<br>
    Mnique Aara<br>
