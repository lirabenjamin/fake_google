                I hate cover letters. They add so much stress to the already uncomfortable and grueling job hunt. Every time I'm writing one, I find myself wondering: Do people even read these?
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                Unfortunately, the answer is "yes." But, there are some ways to make the process a little less terrible. I asked Amy Gallo, Harvard Business Review editor and author of "How to Write a Cover Letter," for her advice. From doing the research, to starting off strong, to emphasizing your value ‚Äî Gallo taught me exactly what I need to do to get my cover letters noticed by hiring managers. I even wrote a new cover letter that has her blessing. (Scroll down if you're in need of an expert-approved example.)

But the cover letter is important. It's time to face our fears, and just figure out how in the world we are actually going to write it.

                In front of me right now are three cover letters that I've written in the past, for three different jobs. And I'm just embarrassed. I'm embarrassed to read these.

            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                I talked to Amy Gallo, an HBR editor, and the author of one of our most popular articles, "How to Write a Cover Letter."
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>AMY GALLO:</strong> First of all, you're not alone. I write about how to write cover letters, and I also hate them.
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>ELAINY MATA:</strong> She's done the research. She's talked to the experts. And I'm going to tell you exactly what she told me.
            </div>

            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">Make it one page</h3>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>ELAINY MATA:</strong> So how long does a cover letter actually have to be? Just one page, one.
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>AMY GALLO:</strong> Don't play with the font, and make it like eight point font, and like make your margins really wide. Just really figure out what is the most essential things that need to go on one page.
            </div>

            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">Do research, find a name</h3>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>ELAINY MATA:</strong> This should be a no-brainer, but let's get specific. Let's say you're applying for a job here, at Harvard Business Review. Go on the company's website, go to their "About Us" section, and read what they're about, see their mission statement, see their tone, see what that company is actually looking for, and what they stand for.
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                So you've got the broad stuff, but let's dig a little bit deeper. What is the company that you're applying for talking about now? You should actually go into their LinkedIn, their Twitter, see what they're sharing, see who are they're talking to, see what they're talking about, so you can get a sense of what is currently happening. Lastly, find that hiring manager. It is so much better to address your cover letter to an actual person and a name rather than, to whom it may concern. So I have to kind of creep a little bit, and be like a private investigator.
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>AMY GALLO:</strong> Yeah, creeping is definitely part of the process. Usually, with LinkedIn, you can see who's posted the job, who is sharing it with their network. You may not know for sure that that's the hiring manager, but at least it's a little more personable. Sometimes, I've heard people just reach out and say, "Who's the hiring manager for this job? I'd like to address my cover letter to that person."
            </div>

                <strong>ELAINY MATA:</strong> You've probably written this 100 times before. "Hi, my name is this. I'm based here, and I'm applying for this job." No, no, no, no, don't do that. The hiring manager has a stack of cover letters. So you have to write yours to grab their attention. Amy, can you please give me an example of a strong, bold, opening line for cover letter. I promise I won't steal it.

                <strong>ELAINY MATA:</strong> Figure out what problem the company is facing. They're hiring for a reason. Figure out what that reason is, and how you can best solve that problem. Amy also found the top two qualities that people generally look for is adaptability, and the ability to learn quickly.

                How about if I just got out of college, and I'm looking at these jobs that are asking for three to five years or more of experience. How can I write a cover letter if I feel like I don't have enough to write about?
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>AMY GALLO:</strong> Yeah, so that's a good question, because the cover letter shouldn't be focused so much on the past. That's the resume's job. The cover letter is really about the future. So how are you going to take what's in that resume, your past, and apply it to where you're going.

                <strong>ELAINY MATA:</strong> This is really hard to balance. You want to show them that you're excited to work there, and that you're going to bring a lot of energy to the team. But don't be too strong, because over eagerness can actually work against you.

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>ELAINY MATA:</strong> So getting a second pair of eyes will help you look for any errors, typos, and most importantly, they can tell you if you make sense.

            <div class="article-text">
                Amy, this sounds like a lot. Is there even like a sort of a shortcut to this, or a sort of scalable way that I can do this for multiple different jobs?
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>AMY GALLO:</strong> I mean, you've probably heard the phrase looking for a job is a full-time job. It does take a lot of time. You're tweaking some things. You're not writing a whole new letter. So you're going to have a template. Write your best cover letter for the first job you apply for. Share that with your friend to check the tone. Do the research on the company, right? Do that the first time. Then and adjust the cover letter accordingly. Does that seem more reasonable?
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>ELAINY MATA:</strong> Yes, much more reasonable.

                So my task is to apply for a job here at HBR, and to write a new cover letter using the advice that Amy gave me. Let's do it.

                This is hard. I never said it was going to be easy, maybe easier than what you were doing before, but definitely not easy.

                Dear Maureen and hiring team,<br><br>
                I saw your listing on LinkedIn and am excited because this is exactly the job that I've been looking for to showcase my skills in video production and production management to assist the creative center in producing compelling content.<br><br>
                Working in news and movie production has taught me to hear an idea and a concept and be able to fully plan out the logistics needed to make the desired final visual product. I have been able to work with software like Adobe Creative Suite and TriCaster, and have worked with other team members to write scripts and compose story boards.<br><br>
                Being part of the Creative Center team will give me the challenges to grow as a skilled producer and assist in production, help the production planning process, create a quick turn around for video publication, and manage content.

                <strong>AMY GALLO:</strong> I read this, I'm like, that first sentence is spot on. And then it gets a little bit stilted. And then it goes into what's probably on your resume. And I want a little more personality.

            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>AMY GALLO:</strong> All right. So I'm looking at it right now. And I think you did a really good job.
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                You've got the main components here. There's some personality in it. There's some flattery in it about the company you're applying to, but it's not like over the top. I have to tell you, I would have you in. I think it's a great letter.
            </div>

            <div class="article-text">
                <strong>ELAINY MATA:</strong> That's it for me. I wrote the cover letter. You got to see the whole process. And I feel like I definitely have a better outlook on how to approach it. These are not easy to write, so good luck out there. Watch as many times as you can. Practice makes perfect. I'll see you soon.

            <div class="article-text" style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 5px; font-style: italic;">
                Dear Maureen and hiring team,<br><br>
                I was so excited to see your post on LinkedIn because it's exactly the type of job I'm looking for: an opportunity to bring my experience with video production and enthusiasm for storytelling to an organization that sets the standard for high-quality management content.<br><br>
                In addition to five years of experience in broadcast journalism, research, and video production, I would bring an organized and systems-level perspective to this role. I view video production as a puzzle, and like to think about which parts need to come together in order to make a great final product. My approach is to have in-depth conversations with my team members, and the various stakeholders, before each project. This helps me nail down the logistics ‚Äî from location to talent.<br><br>
                From there, the fun begins: fleshing out the concept and identifying what visuals will best represent it. Ideation and storyboarding are essential in this step. I know I'm not right all the time, so I enjoy working with a diverse team that can bring in new perspectives, brainstorm, and pitch ideas that will make the final product stronger. Whenever possible, I also try to seek out other sources for inspiration, like magazines, which allow me to observe different ways of expression and storytelling. This approach has served me well. It's what has allowed me to enter the film industry and grow as a creator.<br><br>
                On my website, you can see examples of how I use the above process to create fun, engaging content.<br><br>
                Given this experience and my enthusiasm for the work you do, I believe I'd make a great addition to your team. I recently had a chance to try out your Patient Zero product at my current organization. The simulation is both challenging and engaging. I was impressed by your ability to apply different storytelling methods to an online training course (which, let's admit, can often be a little dry). Your work exemplifies exactly what I believe: There's an opportunity to tell a compelling story in everything ‚Äî all you have to do is deliver it right.<br><br>
                I'd love to come in and speak with you more about what I'd be able to offer in this role. Harvard Business Publishing is my top choice and I believe I'd make valuable contributions to your team.<br><br>
                Thank you for your time and consideration!
            </div>
