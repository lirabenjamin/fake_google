    <pre>I was A2A, so I'll give it a shot. I have 2 examples to share. One is amusing. One is actually good. Both read like they were written by smart, functional, thinking human beings. Sadly, this is rarer than you might think.

Amusing

Heh, so, I wouldn't say that this is strictly the best cover letter I've seen across all dimensions, but it's certainly one of the most memorable. Though we initially reached out of a morbid fascination (coupled with a strong resume), it did get our attention enough to bring on someone that ended up staying with the company in question for 6 years, evangelizing UX like crazy, slaying cruft and bullshit at every turn, and all in all, being one of the best PMs I've ever had the pleasure of working with. For context, the gentleman in question wrote this gem when he was a new grad.

Dear Recruitment Officer:

The fact that you are reading this means that I am already dead. Had I still been amongst the living, I could have brought my passion for improving user experiences and innovative software to your company. I would have used my excellent analytical skills to help improve current projects and envision new ones. My communications and interpersonal skills would have been utilized to maintain an efficient and pleasant office environment. My ability to quickly learn and apply new skills would have allowed me to contribute positively to a wide range of projects. All in all, I would have become an integral part of my team. Unfortunately, I am dead. Fortunately, Dr. Frank N. Stein assures me that my current state can be worked around, and aside from occasionally being chased by pitchfork-wielding villagers, I would remain an exceptional employee. I hope to hear from you in the future.

Sincerely,

[snip] “It’s Alive” [snip]
I want to emphasize that cutesy things like this are not a substitute for being good at stuff. If this candidate's resume hadn't been strong of its own accord, this letter would have been less charming and more... pathetic. One thing to note is that this letter is well-written, and that's actually huge (most cover letters are rife with typos, grammatical errors, and confusing, unclear writing).

Actually Good

Greetings!

I was browsing through CrunchBoard where I saw that you're hiring. I'm a smart and hardworking guy who's just starting his programming career, and I'm looking to do some great work. [snip] sounds like a really cool place to do said work, and I very much hope I can be a useful addition to the team.

I've put together a practice and demonstration project that you can check out, built using Python and Django. It's a simple, moderately-customizable to-do list that allows the user to estimate how long tasks take, and then compare their estimates with how long they actually took. The source is available on github here. I've also attached my resume, and my LinkedIn profile has some additional background.

All the very best,
[snip]

This doesn't look like much, but from reading it, it's clear that a smart, thinking person who is at least a little bit passionate about coding wrote it. You'd think that letters like this would be common, but believe me, they're not. When you see something so simple, well-written, and earnest in a sea of platitudes, cliches, and rampant grammatical errors, you sit up and take notice.

What are the best tips for essay writing?
If you want to write better essays, it’s helpful to understand the criteria teachers use to score them. Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given, focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve, even if you are already getting a high grade.

Development of Your Thesis

A thesis is the essence of your paper—the claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at ha
