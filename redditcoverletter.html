                From what I understand a cover letter needs to stand out and show personality. It can't read like AI or simply regurgitate your resume. As I'm applying for HUNDREDS of jobs it would be helpful to see a WOW cover letter and base mine off that. Anyone have a great example I can turn into my own?

                    As a recruiter, cover letters are only required when we fail to convince the hiring manager to not have a cover letter.<br><br>
                    Myself and every recruiter I know just skips them and goes right to the resume.

                    I'm gonna go against the grain here and sing the praises of a good, personal, cover letter.<br><br>
                    
                    Sure, most places won't read it. Doesn't matter. Some places will read it. This is your one opportunity at the application stage to speak directly to a human. Tell your story. Sell yourself. Stand out. Computers parse resumes for keywords, cover letters are for human to human communication. Swing for the fences. Go for broke. Be interesting and entertaining.<br><br>

                    Don't make your cover letter a summary of your resume in paragraph form. Spell correctly and use correct grammar, but don't get all weird with professional wording. Write it like you ran into the HR person at the gym or the store and you have their ear for a minute.<br><br>

                    I just got hired for my top choice position and I had 4 interviews on about 50 applications. Every single one of them mentioned my cover letter being very unique and one reason (but not the only) they wanted to meet me.<br><br>

                    I'll DM you mine if you want, but I don't feel like editing out personal info and I don't want to post it publicly here.

                    I was told by a recruiter that my cover letter alone was enough to get me the interview. So I submit here as an example. I have removed actual content that would identify the company. I'm sure there will be other folks who would find plenty to improve on this, but this particular recruiter said it was one that stood out.

                        Dear [recruiter name],<br><br>

                        I was struck by [anecdote on the company website]; first by its expression of service elegance at its quintessence, and then by the moment of revelation for me that followed. I saw before me the destination to which, and for which, my past career choices had been leading and preparing me. Here, was not only my dream organization - one that venerates luxury service in the way that I do - but also my dream position within it.<br><br>

                        You, of course, know that "quote describing the essence of their service" demands much from its specialists. It is an ideal of true perfection that must be crafted by the hands of white-gloved service, from the hearts of ardent believers, and with the energy of a thousand suns.<br><br>

                        Service of this caliber does not happen by accident, and thus, it is with great enthusiasm that I submit my resume for your position of XXXXXXXXXX.<br><br>

                        My career has always been about one thing, my love of service excellence. What could I bring to this position? I have an infectious enthusiasm for service standards, I have worked with the building blocks of quality, I am an expert in the mechanisms of service delivery and the tools of continuous improvement, I have one-on-one and group training skills, I am a nuanced communicator and coach, and I am a team player who knows how damaging departmental silos are to the customer experience.<br><br>

                        Review of my resume will reveal a curious career path, or should I say paths. I spent the first half of my career in the hospitality industry â€“ leading service culture, service delivery, training and development, quality improvement, human resources, and employee engagement initiatives.<br><br>

                        The second half of my career enabled me to build my own firm and to implement my vision for the customer experience. As partner in a boutique firm offering demand generation services to cybersecurity clients â€“ I have invested deeply in high-touch, customized engagements, and relationships with discerning customers.<br><br>

                        Now I find myself yearning again for my rootsâ€¦to be part of a team working together to achieve extraordinary client experiences. [Company name]'s mission is my own, and the place where I feel I belong.<br><br>

                        Thank you for your consideration, and I hope to have an opportunity to contribute to [company name]'s vision of world-class, luxury service.

                    My last cover letter got me hired. But I tailored it to the specific job I wanted. I was honest about my professional background and how this was the job I've always wanted and I got an interview. I see cover letters as a chance to show off your verbal skills and also show the employer that you want the job more than the next guy.

                        Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>

                        I believe that challenging the status quo can sometimes create a path that leads to the greatest development and innovation. Coincidentally, my personal path has not been "status quo," as I've challenged myself to strengthen my abilities and gain a deeper understanding of the CPG business through a variety of roles with xxx. My tenure has been something I've been quite proud of, and I do not take it lightly when considering other career options. But I am ready to challenge myself once again & reject my current reality of the "status quo," which is why I am applying for your open position, Associate Brand Manager for xxx.<br><br>

                        Upon quick review of my resume, you may have noticed that I have experience on both sides of the business, both in retail and in corporate roles. This has allowed me to become very well-rounded on the realities of either end, but more specifically it has made me especially strong at connecting with people and building on those relationships. My interpersonal skillset saw exponential growth when I was the Store Manager at our xxx location during the height of COVID. There were many situations during that period, where I had to demonstrate empathy & handle every interaction with care, to not only our associates, but to also our customers and vendors.<br><br>

                        During the same timeframe while at the store, we were still dealing with political and social tensions domestically, and because of that, my involvement within xxx internal Business Resource Groups grew. I lead both the BIPOC and LGBTQ+ Business Resource Groups in xxx. I received great satisfaction from helping educate peers and emerging leaders about Unconscious Bias & what they could do to make their stores more inclusive. And I'll be honest â€“ xxx's focus on Social and Racial Justice, is what makes working for the company so appealing, because I believe our values align.<br><br>

                        Beyond my experience as a People Leader, I believe my Marketing IQ is another asset to my personal portfolio, since specializing in the regional markets of xxx, xxx and xxx. I developed hyper-local marketing plans, including billboards, print and digital ads to drive traffic into our stores in highly competitive markets.<br><br>

                        If given this job, I will leverage my knowledge and years of experience as a People Leader in the CPG field to challenge the status quo so I can help xxx achieve their goal of aiming to be a 1.4Mâ‚¬ brand by 2027 â€“ but more importantly help drive change via their social mission through thoughtful and creative brand planning.<br><br>

                        I hope I've gained your attention. Thank you for reviewing my application and taking the time to read my letter.
